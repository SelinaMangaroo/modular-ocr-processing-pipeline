My dear Mr. NoCourt :-  
Yours regarding La Junta at hand and I cannot afford to play a  
town the sims unless I can get a guarantee.  
Ad mat for your kindness, I am,  
Yours very truly,  
Ex August 28th, 1901.

Dear Mr. Welsh :-  
I need not tell you that we were extremely disappointed in the  
opening business at Boston.  
It was a great disappointment and even with the season  
and weather to contend with, the opening should have been much better; the very first  
performance of the play at Albany before it had a New York reputation and with nothing  
to commend it excepting the cast, was nearly as good as Monday night; the gross being  
$240.00. I wish you would kindly send to this office at your earliest convenience  
the Sunday "Ada" and advance notices, as it may be that we have made a mistake in the  
manner in which our advertising has been placed.  
Whatever is at fault we should  
remedy it at once, and we wish you would kindly study the conditions carefully, and  
try to arouse a greater interest in the play.  
I wish to call your attention to the fact that the word comedy does not  
appear in your daily "ads" at present; this is very essential, as the title itself  
suggests melodrama.
