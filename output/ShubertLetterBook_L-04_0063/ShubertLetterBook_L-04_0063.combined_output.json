    "3  \nAugust 28th, 1901.  \nMr. Peter HoCourt,  \nKer. Tabor Grand,  \nDenver, Col.  \nMy dear Mr. NoCourt :-  \nYours regarding La Junta at hand and I cannot afford to play a  \ntown the sims unless I can get a guarantee.  \nAd mat for your kindness, I am,  \nYours very truly,  \nEx August 28th, 1901.  \nDeshler Welsh, Ed.,  \nBusiness Manager,  \nThe Brixton Burglary,  \nHollis Street Theatre,  \nBoston, Mass.  \nDear Mr. Welsh :-  \nI need not tell you that we were extremely disappointed in the  \nopening business at Boston.  \nIt was a great disappointment and even with the season  \nand weather to contend with, the opening should have been much better; the very first  \nperformance of the play at Albany before it had a New York reputation and with nothing  \nto commend it excepting the cast, was nearly as good as Monday night; the gross being  \n$240.00. I wish you would kindly send to this office at your earliest convenience  \nthe Sunday \"Ada\" and advance notices, as it may be that we have made a mistake in the  \nmanner in which our advertising has been placed.  \nWhatever is at fault we should  \nremedy it at once, and we wish you would kindly study the conditions carefully, and  \ntry to arouse a greater interest in the play.  \nI wish to call your attention to the fact that the word comedy does not  \nappear in your daily \"ads\" at present; this is very essential, as the title itself  \nsuggests melodrama."
