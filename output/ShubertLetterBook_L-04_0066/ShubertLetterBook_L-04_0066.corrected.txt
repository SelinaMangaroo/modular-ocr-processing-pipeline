12 Barclay St, City.  
Deux 318:  
Your bill of Ost, Lat account of advertising "Andrew Hack" is waived, and  
wish to say that this theatre has not placed advertising matter after the first week of  
the performances, with your publication. The first announcement which came at the time of  
the opening was authorized here, and for which we agreed to pay $10.00. If any later  
advertising was placed it must have been done by Mr. Bob Hack, who represents Rich and  
Harris, and it will be necessary to collect the amount of your bill from Mr. Hogarty,  
Manager of the Company now at the Theatre, or of IS. Harris at the Garrick Theatre.  
I  
thought I would write and tell you, so that you might have time to settle the matter by  
before the company closes Saturday night. The one insertion authorized by us has been  
paid for.  
Yours truly,
