Deux 318:"
Your bill of Ost, Lat account of advertising "Andrew Hack" zawaived, and
wish to say that this theatre has not placed divertising matter after the first week of
the performances, with your publication. The first announcement which cane at the time of
the opening was author ised here, and for which we agreed to pay $10.00. If any Later
sivertising was placed it must have been done by Mr. Bob Hack, who represents Rich and
Herris, and it will be necessary to collect the amount of your bill from Mr. Hogarty",
Manager of the Company now at the Theatre, or of IS. Harris at the Garrick Theatra.
I
thought I would write and tell you, so that you might have time to settle the mather by-
fors the company closes Saturday night. The one insertion authorized by us has been
paid for.
Yours truly,
