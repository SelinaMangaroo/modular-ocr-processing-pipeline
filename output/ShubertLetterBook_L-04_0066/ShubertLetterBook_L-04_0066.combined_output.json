    "Ir a Patrick Ford,  \nThe Tr√°ch World,  \n12 Barclay St, City.  \nDeux 318:  \nYour bill of Ost, Lat account of advertising \"Andrew Hack\" is waived, and  \nwish to say that this theatre has not placed advertising matter after the first week of  \nthe performances, with your publication. The first announcement which came at the time of  \nthe opening was authorized here, and for which we agreed to pay $10.00. If any later  \nadvertising was placed it must have been done by Mr. Bob Hack, who represents Rich and  \nHarris, and it will be necessary to collect the amount of your bill from Mr. Hogarty,  \nManager of the Company now at the Theatre, or of IS. Harris at the Garrick Theatre.  \nI  \nthought I would write and tell you, so that you might have time to settle the matter by  \nbefore the company closes Saturday night. The one insertion authorized by us has been  \npaid for.  \nYours truly,"
