I have just received a communication from . That other in which he states that the shipping instructions given by him for the Belle of New York Colares Sem not been followed carefully, and that as a consequence in many cases he shall have arrived too late to be distributed properly.  
As had asked the to Aske a request that him anders be followed carefully in the future and that the orders be filled more promptly.  
In shipping paper to a city by freight, especially in the far work what. packages are WAS handled a number of times, they should be packed and tind note Boozely, as many of the packages have been broken open when received. I wish you would look this matter up, as I imagine it must be carelessness in your shipping department, of which you are not aware.

I received a letter from Salt Lake City which speaks for Staal's the matter has probably been taken onops of ere this.  
The given on Monday with "The New Yorker" it is Dan Daly's non color and I mightily hope it will prove a successful engagement for the house: it certainly looks like a winner.  
Yours very truly,
