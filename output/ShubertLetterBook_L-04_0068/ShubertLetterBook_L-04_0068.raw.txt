I have just received a communication from . Thatother in which he
states that the shipping instructions given by hin for the Belle of New York Colares Sem
not been followed carefully, and that as a consequence in many dades he shelley have
arrived too late to be distributed properly .
As had asked the to Aske a request that
him anders be followed carefully in the future und that the orders be filled more
promptly.
In shipping paper to a City by freight, especially in the far work what.
packages are WAS handled a member of times, they should be parked and tind note Boozely,
as many of the packages have been broken opener when received. I wish you wo JA Noch
this matter up, as I imagine it must be carelessness in your shipping department, of thish
you are not aware.
Yours very truly,
