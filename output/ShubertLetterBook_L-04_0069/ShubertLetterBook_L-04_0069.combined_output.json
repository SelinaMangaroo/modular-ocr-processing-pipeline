    "Balls of the Park,  \nPortland, Preten.  \nDear Us, Zvati :-  \nI received a letter from Hr. Thelastmer yesterday in which he states that the host amount for the herald used by the Bells of New York is than unsettled conditions, and that he has been unable to obtain the weekly atarint from the. I en get apprised at this, as itr. Hart understands that remittances are not to be made direct to him, as the printing he is doing for the Bells of New York is to apply on his account for the programme privilege at the Baker Theatre, Rochester. I would therefore suggest that we pay for the same as we did in the Stranger in New York heralds a few seasons ago. The entire amount is $285.00 and I have suggested to Abo that $74.80 be charged to him for twenty consecutive weeks starting the week after this letter is received, making the check payable to J. J. Shubert, and send it back work over to the Baker Theatre or direct to this office. In this way, the entire credit of $885.00 will be given to the Baker Theatre at the expiration of the twenty weeks, and the heralds will have been paid for. I hope this is entirely plain to you and that you will have no trouble in spreading the matter satisfactorily without conflating your statement.  \nEnd of the engagement.  \nMrs. Zweifel was in for seats for the Saturday matinee at this theatre, and I sent them to her today, so I imagine she is coming over to see Andrer Kask before I- I hope you are having a pleasant trip, and that you will write occasionally.  \nI received the critics' of the various towns, and am keeping a scrapbook of them.  \nYours very truly,  \nBelle of New York,  \nDenver, Col.  \nDear Aba :-  \nI received your favor of the 27th, and have written to Mr. Hart instructing him that he must be more careful in making your shipments, and also requesting him to tie the packages more securely in the future.  \nIn regard to the statement, I think it would be a good idea to make payments as we did with the Stranger in New York heralds a few seasons ago, as the remittances for this printing must not be made direct to Hart, but to J. J. Shubert, Baker Theatre, Rochester, or direct to this office instead, as Mr. Hart is not to have this money but it is to be paid to the Baker, and applied on his programme account. I would suggest with starting next week, or rather the week after this letter is received, that you charge $14.85 per week for the use of heralds for twenty consecutive weeks, which would make a total of $85.00 for the one hundred thousand edition we have ordered. By charging this amount weekly it would simplify the account and at the end of the twenty weeks, the heralds would be paid for, and the Baker Theatre would have the $888.00 which has been credited in Hart's account.  \nPlease reply upon receipt of this letter, stating whether or not the wall."
