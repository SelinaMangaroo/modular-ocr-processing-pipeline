    "August 28th 1801.  Messes. Klaw & Erlanger,  1440 Broadway,  New York City.  Gentlemen:  As per your letter, I have changed the time for Arthur Byron from Oct. 23rd to Oct. 30th at Albany, N. Y.  Yours very truly,  P. S.  Enclosed find letter from John H. Springer: his terms are not in equity for an attraction like the Belle of New York. Should he care to make the terms the same as past season, I will try and arrange my route whereby I could use a week at the Grand Opera House in the month of January or month of April 1902: I might also arrange to play Brooklyn and Boston in said months providing the terms are satisfactory.",
    "August 28th 1801.  Mr. Jos. M. Kelly,  Mgr. National Theatre,  Phila, Pa.  My dear Mr. Kelly:  Your letter of ANE, 7th has been mislaid and inasmuch as Australia does not open its season until Sept. 23rd, the only time I could use would be either the week of Sept. 30th or Oct. 28th or Nov. 4th. If you could arrange to open up either one of the said weeks, kindly wire me c/o Herald Square Theatre. You can rest assured of a first-class company and production.  With best wishes for a very prosperous season, I remain,  Yours very truly,"
