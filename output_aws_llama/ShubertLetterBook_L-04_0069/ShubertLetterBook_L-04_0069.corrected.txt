Dear Mr. Zweifel:-

I received a letter from 140 Thalheimer yesterday in which he stated
that the Hart account for the heralds used by the Belle of New York is in an unsettled
condition, and that he has been unable to obtain the weekly statement from them. I am
got surprised at this, as Mr. Hart understands that remittances are not to be made direct
to him, as the printing house is doing for the Bells of New York, which is to apply on his
account for the programme privilege at the Baker Theatre, Rochester.  I would therefore suggest
that 1949 pay for them the same amount as they did in the Stranger in New York heralds a few 
sonas ago. The entire amount is $285. & more I have suggested to Hart that $24.85 be charged him 
for twenty consecutive weeks starting the week after this letter is received, making the check payable 
to J. J. Shubert, and send it every week over to the Baker Theatre or direct to this office, so that 
the entire credit of $285.00 will be given the Baker Theatre at the completion of the twenty weeks, 
And the heralds will have been paid for. I hope this is entirely plain to you and that you will have no 
trouble in springing the matter satisfactorily complicating your statement.

Mrs. Zweifel wants in two seats for the Saturday matinee at this theatre, and
I sent them to her today, so I imagine she is coming over to 506 Andrew Mack before the 
and of the engagement.
: here you are having or pleasant trip, and that you will write periodically.

I received the critics' notices of the various shows, and am keeping a record book of their business NET,
Yours very truly,
Belle of New York,

Dear Abe:-

a

I received your favour of the 27th, and have written to Mr. Hart instructing 
him that he must be more careful in making your shipments, and also requesting him to
tie the packages more securely in the future.
In regard to the statement, I think it would be a good idea to make payments
as we did with the Stranger in New York heralds & few seasons ago, as the remittances 
for this printing must not be made direct to Hart, but to J. J. Shubert, Baker Theatre,
Rochester, or direct to this office instead, as Mr. Hart is not to have this money but
it into be paid to the Baker, and applied on his programme account. I would suggest 
with starting next week, or rather the week after this letter is received, that you 
charge $14.25 per week for the use of heralds for twenty consecutive weeks, which would 
make a total of $285.00 for the one hundred thousand edition we have ordered. By charging 
this amount weekly it would simplify the account and at the end of the twenty weeks, the 
heralds would be paid for, and the Baker Theatre would have the $885.00 which has been 
credited Mr. Hart's account.
Please write its response upon receipt of this letter, stating whether or not none
