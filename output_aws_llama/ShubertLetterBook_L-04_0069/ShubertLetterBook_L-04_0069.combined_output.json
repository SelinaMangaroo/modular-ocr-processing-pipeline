    "Here is the corrected text:\n\nOct. 3rd, 1901.\n\n12. Pred V. Treffy, HEAD\nBelle at New York,\nPortland, Oregon.\nDear Mr. Zweifel:-\n\nI received a letter from 140 Thalheimer yesterday in which he stated\nthat the Hart account for the heralds used by the Belle of New York is in an unsettled\ncondition, and that he has been unable to obtain the weekly statement from them. I am\ngot surprised at this, as Mr. Hart understands that remittances are not to be made direct\nto him, as the printing house is doing for the Bells of New York, which is to apply on his\naccount for the programme privilege at the Baker Theatre, Rochester.  I would therefore suggest\nthat 1949 pay for them the same amount as they did in the Stranger in New York heralds a few \nsonas ago. The entire amount is $285. & more I have suggested to Hart that $24.85 be charged him \nfor twenty consecutive weeks starting the week after this letter is received, making the check payable \nto J. J. Shubert, and send it every week over to the Baker Theatre or direct to this office, so that \nthe entire credit of $285.00 will be given the Baker Theatre at the completion of the twenty weeks, \nAnd the heralds will have been paid for. I hope this is entirely plain to you and that you will have no \ntrouble in springing the matter satisfactorily complicating your statement.\n\nMrs. Zweifel wants in two seats for the Saturday matinee at this theatre, and\nI sent them to her today, so I imagine she is coming over to 506 Andrew Mack before the \nand of the engagement.\n: here you are having or pleasant trip, and that you will write periodically.\n\nI received the critics' notices of the various shows, and am keeping a record book of their business NET,\nYours very truly,\nBelle of New York,\nMark\nDenver, Col.\n\nDear Abe:-\n\na\n\nI received your favour of the 27th, and have written to Mr. Hart instructing \nhim that he must be more careful in making your shipments, and also requesting him to\ntie the packages more securely in the future.\nIn regard to the statement, I think it would be a good idea to make payments\nas we did with the Stranger in New York heralds & few seasons ago, as the remittances \nfor this printing must not be made direct to Hart, but to J. J. Shubert, Baker Theatre,\nRochester, or direct to this office instead, as Mr. Hart is not to have this money but\nit into be paid to the Baker, and applied on his programme account. I would suggest \nwith starting next week, or rather the week after this letter is received, that you \ncharge $14.25 per week for the use of heralds for twenty consecutive weeks, which would \nmake a total of $285.00 for the one hundred thousand edition we have ordered. By charging \nthis amount weekly it would simplify the account and at the end of the twenty weeks, the \nheralds would be paid for, and the Baker Theatre would have the $885.00 which has been \ncredited Mr. Hart's account.\nPlease write its response upon receipt of this letter, stating whether or not none"
