    "Mr. Peter McCourt,\nMgr. Tabor Grand,\nDenver, Co.\nMy dear Mr. MeCourt:-\nYours regarding La Junta at hand and I cannot afford to play R\ntown the size of Junta unless I can get a guarantee.\nThanking you for your kindness, I am,\nYours very truly,\nA Thares \nAugust 28th 1901.",
    "Deshler Wellh, Each\nBusiness Manager,\nThe Brixton Burglary,\nHollis Street Theatre,\nBoston, Mass.\nE\nDear Mr. Welsh:-\nI need not tell you that we were extremely disappointed in the\nopening business at Boston. It was a great disappointment and even with the season\nand weather to contend with the opening should have been much better; The very first\nperformance of the play at Albany before it had a New York reputation and with nothing\nto commend it except the cast, was nearly as good as Monday night; the gross being\n$240.00. I wish you would kindly send to this office at your earliest convenience\nthe Sunday \"Ade\" and advance notices, as it may be that we have made a mistake in \nthe manner in which our advertising has been placed. Whatever is at fault we should\nready it at once, and we wish you would kindly study the conditions carefully, and\ntry to arouse a greater interest in the play.\nI wish to call your attention to the fact, that the word \"comedy\" does not\nappear in your daily \"Ads\" at present; this is very essential, as the title itself\nsuggests melodrama."
