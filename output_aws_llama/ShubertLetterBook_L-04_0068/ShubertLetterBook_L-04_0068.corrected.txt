3rd. 1901.

Mr. Mart Printer,
South Avenue,
Rochester, N.Y.
Dear Mr. Horts-
I have just received a letter from V. Thalheimer in which he
states that the shipping instructions given by his clerk for the Belle in New York followers have
not been followed carefully, and that as a consequence, in many cases the circulars have
arrived too late to be distributed properly. To have asked them to make a request that
his orders be followed carefully in the future, and that the orders be filled more promptly.
In shipping paper to B. City by freight, especially in the Pacific Northwest where
packages are often handled by a member of the crew, they should be packed and tied more securely,
as many of the packages have been broken open when received. I wish you would take
this matter up, as I imagine it must be carelessness in your shipping department, of which
you are not aware.

Yours very truly,
A. To -:

I recieve a letter from Salt Lake City which speaks for itself:
The new show opens on Monday with "The New Yorkers" it is Ban Daly's now show and Y ain-
cerely hope it will prove a successful engagement for the house; it certainly looks like
a winner.

Yours very truly,
