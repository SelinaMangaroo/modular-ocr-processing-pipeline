    "Dear Mr. Horts-\nI have just received a letter from V. Thalheimer in which he\nstates that the shipping instructions given by his clerk for the Belle in New York followers have\nnot been followed carefully, and that as a consequence, in many cases the circulars have\narrived too late to be distributed properly. To have asked them to make a request that\nhis orders be followed carefully in the future, and that the orders be filled more promptly.\nIn shipping paper to B. City by freight, especially in the Pacific Northwest where\npackages are often handled by a member of the crew, they should be packed and tied more securely,\nas many of the packages have been broken open when received. I wish you would take\nthis matter up, as I imagine it must be carelessness in your shipping department, of which\nyou are not aware.\nYours very truly,\nA. To -:\n",
    "I recieve a letter from Salt Lake City which speaks for itself:\nThe new show opens on Monday with \"The New Yorkers\" it is Ban Daly's now show and Y ain-\ncerely hope it will prove a successful engagement for the house; it certainly looks like\na winner.\nYours very truly,"
