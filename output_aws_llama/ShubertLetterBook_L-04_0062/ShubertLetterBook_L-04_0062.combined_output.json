Y.\nYours very truly,\nP.S. Enclosed find letter from John H. Springer; his terms are not in equity for\nan attraction like the Belle of New York. Should he care to make the terms same as\npast season, I will try and arrange my route whereby I could use a week at the Grand\nOpera House in the month of January or month of April 1902: I might also arrange to\nplay Brooklyn and Boston in said months providing the terms are satisfactory.",
