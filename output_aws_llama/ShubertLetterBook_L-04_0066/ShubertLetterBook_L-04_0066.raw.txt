Door Sir:-
Your bill of Dot, lat account or advertising "Andrev Mack® received, and
wish to say that this theatre her not placed advertising matter after the first week of
the performance, with your publication. The first annowncement which came at the time of
the opening was authorized here, and for which we agreed to pay $10.00. If any later
advertising was placed it must have been done by Mr. Bob Hack, who represents Rich and
Harris. and it will be necessary to sollect the amount of your bill from Mr. Hogarty,
Manager of the Company now at the Theatre, or of №. Harris nt the Garrick Theatre. I
thought I would write and tell you, 80 that you might have time to settle the matter
foro the company closes Baturday night. The are insertion authorized by us has been
paid for.
Yours truly,
