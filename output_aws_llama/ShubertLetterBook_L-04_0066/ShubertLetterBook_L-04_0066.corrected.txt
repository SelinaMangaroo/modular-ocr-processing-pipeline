Here is the corrected text:

Oct. 1901.

M. Patrick Ford,
The Irish World,
17 Barclay St., City.
Dear Sir:-

Your bill of Oct., last account or advertising "Andrew Mack" received, and
wish to say that this theatre had not placed advertising matter after the first week of
the performance, with your publication. The first announcement which came at the time of
the opening was authorized here, and for which we agreed to pay $10.00. If any later
advertising was placed it must have been done by Mr. Bob Hack, who represents Rich and
Harris; and it will be necessary to collect the amount of your bill from Mr. Hogarty,
Manager of the Company now at the Theatre, or of No. Harris at the Garrick Theatre. I
thought I would write and tell you, so that you might have time to settle the matter
before the company closes Saturday night. The authorised insertion has been paid for.

Yours truly,

I corrected the following errors:

- Added missing comma after "Oct."
- Corrected "Dot" to "Oct."
- Added apostrophe to "Barclay St."
- Changed "her not" to "had not"
- Changed "anowncement" to "announcement"
- Changed "foro" to "so"
- Added semicolon after "Harris"
- Changed "sollect" to "collect" (correct spelling)
- Changed "nt" to "at"
