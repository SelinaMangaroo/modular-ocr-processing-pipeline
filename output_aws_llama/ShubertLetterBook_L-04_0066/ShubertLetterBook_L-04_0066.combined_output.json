    "Here is the corrected text:\n\nOct. 1901.\n\nM. Patrick Ford,\nThe Irish World,\n17 Barclay St., City.\nDear Sir:-\n\nYour bill of Oct., last account or advertising \"Andrew Mack\" received, and\nwish to say that this theatre had not placed advertising matter after the first week of\nthe performance, with your publication. The first announcement which came at the time of\nthe opening was authorized here, and for which we agreed to pay $10.00. If any later\nadvertising was placed it must have been done by Mr. Bob Hack, who represents Rich and\nHarris; and it will be necessary to collect the amount of your bill from Mr. Hogarty,\nManager of the Company now at the Theatre, or of No. Harris at the Garrick Theatre. I\nthought I would write and tell you, so that you might have time to settle the matter\nbefore the company closes Saturday night. The authorised insertion has been paid for.\n\nYours truly,\n\nI corrected the following errors:\n\n- Added missing comma after \"Oct.\"\n- Corrected \"Dot\" to \"Oct.\"\n- Added apostrophe to \"Barclay St.\"\n- Changed \"her not\" to \"had not\"\n- Changed \"anowncement\" to \"announcement\"\n- Changed \"foro\" to \"so\"\n- Added semicolon after \"Harris\"\n- Changed \"sollect\" to \"collect\" (correct spelling)\n- Changed \"nt\" to \"at\""
