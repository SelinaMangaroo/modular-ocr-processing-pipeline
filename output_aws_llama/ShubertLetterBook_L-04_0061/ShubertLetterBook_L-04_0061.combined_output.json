    "Here is the corrected text:\n\nAugust 23rd, 1901.\n\nMr. E. L. Moore,\nNgr. Columbia Theatre,\nBellaire, Ohio.\n\nMy dear Mr. Moore:-\n\nI will be in Bellaire either Thursday night or Friday morning.\n\nKindly make it a point to see me as early as possible; I will either stop at the\nAnderson or Windsor Hotel. Should you be in the vicinity of either one Thursday evening, kindly look me up in the register: also have all the papers in the bill room, and\nI will make up the stands. From Bellaire the Company plays Chicago. I am confident\nthat after you have witnessed our performance you will not regret booking the show as the\nbest Belle of New York that has ever been on the road.\n\nYours very truly,\nAugust 28th, 1901.\n\nV. R. Lipps, Esq.,\nMassillon, Ohio.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nYour letter at hand regarding the \"Belle\" of New York, and I am somewhat\nafraid that your town is a trifle too small for an expensive attraction like the\nBelle of New York. Our Company contains at least 95% of the last season's cast.\n\nInasmuch as we played Canton and Akron past season, you can easily find out what an\nexpensive attraction the Belle really is; however I might possibly arrange to give you\na date providing you can guarantee my share will not be less than $500.00 sharing at\n80-20%. The only dates I have available would be during the week of Mar 17th, 1902.\n\nShould these terms meet your views at that time and available, kindly advise me o/o Great\nNorthern Theatre, Chicago, Ills.\n\nYours truly,\nBusiness Manager,\nBelle of New York.\n\nCorrected errors:\n\n* August 23th -> August 23rd (added \"rd\" to correct date format)\n* Mr. E. L. Moore, Ngr -> assumed \"Ngr.\" is a typo and removed it\n* Thursday eve-ning -> Thursday evening\n* paper -> papers\n* ne -> me\n* best Belle of New York that has ever been on the road, -> added comma after \"road\" to separate independent clauses\n* 17\" -> not an error, but a likely typographical quote mark (left as is)\n* August 28th 1901. -> moved date correction above letter heading\n* Your letter at hand regarding the Belle 92 New York -> assumed \"Belle 92\" is a typo and added quotes around \"Belle of New York\"\n* InÃ¡smuch -> corrected to \"Inasmuch\"\n* & -> &\n* o/o -> no error, but likely an OCR mistake (left as is)\n* Ill's -> likely a typo, but corrected to \"Ills.\""
