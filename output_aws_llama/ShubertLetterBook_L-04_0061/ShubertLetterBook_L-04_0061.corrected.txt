August 23rd, 1901.

Mr. E. L. Moore,
Ngr. Columbia Theatre,
Bellaire, Ohio.

My dear Mr. Moore:-

I will be in Bellaire either Thursday night or Friday morning.

Kindly make it a point to see me as early as possible; I will either stop at the
Anderson or Windsor Hotel. Should you be in the vicinity of either one Thursday evening, kindly look me up in the register: also have all the papers in the bill room, and
I will make up the stands. From Bellaire the Company plays Chicago. I am confident
that after you have witnessed our performance you will not regret booking the show as the
best Belle of New York that has ever been on the road.

Yours very truly,
August 28th, 1901.

V. R. Lipps, Esq.,
Massillon, Ohio.

Dear Sir:-

Your letter at hand regarding the "Belle" of New York, and I am somewhat
afraid that your town is a trifle too small for an expensive attraction like the
Belle of New York. Our Company contains at least 95% of the last season's cast.

Inasmuch as we played Canton and Akron past season, you can easily find out what an
expensive attraction the Belle really is; however I might possibly arrange to give you
a date providing you can guarantee my share will not be less than $500.00 sharing at
80-20%. The only dates I have available would be during the week of Mar 17th, 1902.

Should these terms meet your views at that time and available, kindly advise me o/o Great
Northern Theatre, Chicago, Ills.

Yours truly,
Business Manager,
Belle of New York.
