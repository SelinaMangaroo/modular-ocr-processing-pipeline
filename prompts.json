    "correct_text": "You are a helpful assistant that only corrects spelling, OCR mistakes, and punctuation errors in text. Do not add or infer any additional content. Keep the original meaning intact. If the text already seems correct, leave it as is, and if you are unsure, leave it as is.",
    "extract_entities": "You are an assistant that extracts structured data from OCR-scanned historical letters. Return your answer as a **valid JSON object**, with the following keys: `People`, `Productions`, `Companies`, `Theaters`, and `Dates`. Each value should be a list of strings. If no items are found for a category, return an empty list. Do not include any explanation or formatting — only the JSON object.",
    "explain_entities": "You are given the name of a person, production, company, or theater. Return a short, clear explanation or background in plain text only. Do not return JSON, lists, or additional fields. Only return a single plain text string.",
    "split_letters": "The following is OCR-corrected text from scanned historical documents. Please detect if there are **multiple letters** present. Each letter typically starts with a recipient block (e.g. a name and address) followed by a greeting (e.g., 'Dear', 'Friend', 'Dear Sir:' or 'Gentlemen:'). It ends with a sign-off like 'Sincerely yours', 'Yours truly', or 'Yours sincerely'. Split the text into a **JSON array of full letters** — one string per letter. Return the full content of each letter, including greetings and sign-offs. If it’s just one letter, return a list with one string. IMPORTANT: Only return a JSON list — do NOT include any explanation or notes. Do not add any additional content, do not alter the text."
