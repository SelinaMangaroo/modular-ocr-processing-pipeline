Mr. Patrick Ford,
The Irish World,
17 Barclay St, City.
Dear Sir:-
Your bill of Oct. 1st account of advertising "Andrew Mack" received, and
wish to say that this theatre has not placed advertising matter after the first week of
the performance, with your publication. The first announcement which came at the time of
the opening was authorized here, and for which we agreed to pay $10.00. If any later
advertising was placed it must have been done by Mr. Bob Mack, who represents Rich and
Harris, and it will be necessary to collect the amount of your bill from Mr. Hogarty,
Manager of the Company now at the Theatre, or of Mr. Harris at the Garrick Theatre. I
thought I would write and tell you, so that you might have time to settle the matter
before the company closes Saturday night. The one insertion authorized by us has been
paid for.
Yours truly,
