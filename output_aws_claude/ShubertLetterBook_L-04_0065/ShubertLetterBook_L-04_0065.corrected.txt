Mr. J. W. N. McCallin,
Cook Opera House,
Rochester, N.Y.
Dear Sir:-
In answer to your request of recent date, I enclose you check for $10.00
balance in full to date account Belles & Beaux. I have looked this matter carefully
and find that this settles all matters in full in accordance with a letter I hold from
you under date of June 2nd. I really feel that the act has paid you a percentage for
many of weeks which you did not assist in booking, as every single week, with the exception of
two which the act has played, were booked outside the Association; however, it is our
intention to live up to our agreements, and we would have continued indefinitely had you
not suggested the discontinuation yourself.
Yours truly,

Sept. 20th 1901.
Homer B. Mason,
Hotel Wellington or Hopkins Theatre,
Chicago, Ills.
Will give you just four hours to wire our money here.

If Homer starts anything today do what you can with others to maintain
harmony. Advise Sextette finishing week; new people coming.
