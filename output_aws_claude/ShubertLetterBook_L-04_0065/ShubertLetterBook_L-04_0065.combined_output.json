    "Sept. 8th 1901.\nMr. J. W. N. McCallin,\nCook Opera House,\nRochester, N.Y.\nDear Sir:-\nIn answer to your request of recent date, I enclose you check for $10.00\nbalance in full to date account Belles & Beaux. I have looked this matter carefully\nand find that this settles all matters in full in accordance with a letter I hold from\nyou under date of June 2nd. I really feel that the act has paid you a percentage for\nmany of weeks which you did not assist in booking, as every single week, with the exception of\ntwo which the act has played, were booked outside the Association; however, it is our\nintention to live up to our agreements, and we would have continued indefinitely had you\nnot suggested the discontinuation yourself.\nYours truly,",
    "Sept. 20th 1901.\nHomer B. Mason,\nHotel Wellington or Hopkins Theatre,\nChicago, Ills.\nWill give you just four hours to wire our money here.\nM. A. Luescher.",
    "Sept. 20th 1901.\nCharles Goulding,\nBeaux and Belles Octette,\nHopkins Theatre,\nChicago, Ills.\nIf Homer starts anything today do what you can with others to maintain\nharmony. Advise Sextette finishing week; new people coming.\nM. A. Luescher."
