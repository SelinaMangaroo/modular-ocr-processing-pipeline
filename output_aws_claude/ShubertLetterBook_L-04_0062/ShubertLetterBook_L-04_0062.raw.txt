Messrs. Klaw & Erlanger,
1440 Broadway,
New York City.
Gentlemen:-
As per your letter have chariged the time for Arthur Byron from Oct, 23th
to Oct, 30th at Albany, N. y.
Yours very truly,
P. S. Enclosed find letter from John H. Springer: his terms are not in equity for
an attraction like the Belle of New York. Should he care to make the terms same as
past season, I will try and arrange my route whereby I could use a. week at the Grand
Opera House in the month of January or month of April 1902: I might also arrange to
play Brooklyn and Boston in said months providing the terms are satisfactory.
August 28th 1901.
Mr. Jos. M. Kelly,
Ngr. National Theatre,
Phila, Pa.
My dear Mr. Kelly:-
Your letter of Aug, 7th has been mislaid and inasmuch as Australia
does not open its season until Sep't 23rd, the only time I could use would be, either
week of Sep't 30th or Oct, 28th or Nov, 4th. If you could arrange to open up either
one of the said weeks, kindly wire me c/o Herald Square Theatre. You can rest assured
of D. first class Company and production.
With best wishes for a very prosperous season, I remain,
Yours very truly,
