    "August 23rd 1901.\nMr. E. L. Moore,\nMgr. Columbia Theatre,\nBellaire, Ohio.\nMy dear Mr. Moore:-\nI will be in Bellaire either Thursday night or Friday morning.\nKindly make it a point to see me as early as possible: I will either stop at the\nAnderson or Windsor Hotel. Should you be in the vicinity of either one Thursday eve-\nning, kindly look me up in the register: also have all the paper in the bill room, and\nI will make up the stands. From Bellaire the Company plays Chicago. I am confident\nafter you have witnessed our performance you will not regret booking the show as the\nbest Belle of New York that has ever been on the road,\nYours very truly,",
    "August 28th 1901.\nV. R. Lipps, Esq.,\nMassillon, Ohio.\nDear Sir:-\nYour letter at hand regarding the Belle of New York, and I am somewhat\nafraid that your town is a trifle too small for an expensive attraction like the\nBelle of New York. Our Company contains at least 95% of the last seasons cast.\nInasmuch as we played Canton and Akron past season, you can easily find out what an\nexpensive attraction the Belle really is: however I might possibly arrange to give you\na date providing you can guarantee my share will not be less than $500.00 sharing at\n80-20%. The only dates I have available would be during the week of Mar. 17th 1902.\nShould these terms meet your views at the time available, kindly advise me c/o Great\nNorthern Theatre, Chicago, Ill's.\nYours truly,\nBusiness Manager,\nBelle of New York."
