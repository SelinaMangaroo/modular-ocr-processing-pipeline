Mr. Marc Horter,
South Avenue,
Rochester, N.Y.
Dear Mr. Horter:-

I have just received a wire from Mr. Thalheimer in which he states that the shipping instructions given by him for the Belle of New York folders have not been followed carefully, and that as a consequence in many cases the circulars have arrived too late to be distributed properly. He has asked me to make a request that his orders be followed carefully in the future, and that the orders be filled more promptly. In shipping paper to N.Y. City by freight, especially in the Far West where packages are handled a number of times, they should be packed and tied more securely, as many of the packages have been broken open when received. I wish you would look this matter up, as I imagine it must be carelessness in your shipping department, of which you are not aware.

Yours very truly,

A.T.:-
I enclose a letter from Salt Lake City which speaks for itself: the matter has probably been taken care of ere this.

They open on Monday with "The New Yorkers" it is Sam Daly's new show and I sincerely hope it will prove a successful engagement for the house: it certainly looks like a winner.

Yours very truly,
