    "Oct. 3rd 1901.\nMr. Fred W. Zweifel, HEAD\nBelle of New York,\nPortland, Oregon.\nDear Mr. Zweifel:-\nI received a letter from Mr. Thalheimer yesterday in which he states\nthat the Hart account for the heralds used by the Belle of New York is in an unsettled\ncondition, and that he has been unable to obtain the weekly statement from them. I am\nnot surprised at this, as Mr. Hart understands that remittances are not to be made direct\nto him, as the printing he is doing for the Belle of New York is to apply on his account\nfor the programme privilege at the Baker Theatre, Rochester. I would therefore suggest\nthat we pay for them the same as we did in the Stranger in New York heralds a few seasons ago. The entire amount is $285. A week I have suggested to Abe that $14.25 be\ncharged him for twenty consecutive weeks starting the week after this letter is received,\nmaking the check payable to J. J. Shubert, and send it each week over to the Baker Theatre\nor direct to this office. In this way the entire credit of $285.00 will be given the\nBaker Theatre at the expiration of the twenty weeks, and the heralds will have been paid\nfor. I hope this is entirely plain to you and that you will have no trouble in arranging\nthe matter satisfactorily completing your statement.\n\nMrs. Zweifel wrote in for seats for the Saturday matinee at this theatre, and\nI sent them to her today, so I imagine she is coming over to see Andrew Mack before the\nend of the engagement.\n\nI hope you are having a pleasant trip, and that you will write occasionally.\nI received the criticisms of the various towns, and am keeping a scrap book of them here.\nBusiness fair.\n\nYours very truly,\nBelle of New York,\nMark",
    "Denver, Col.\nDear Abe:-\n\nI received your favor of the 27th, and have written to Mr. Hart instructing\nhim that he must be more careful in making your shipments, and also requesting him to\ntie the packages more securely in the future.\n\nIn regard to the statement, I think it would be a good idea to make payments\nas we did with the Stranger in New York heralds a few seasons ago, as the remittances\nfor this printing must not be made direct to Hart, but to J. J. Shubert, Baker Theatre,\nRochester, or direct to this office instead, as Mr. Hart is not to have this money but\nit is to be paid to the Baker, and applied on his programme account. I would suggest\nwith starting next week, or rather the week after this letter is received, that you\ncharge $14.25 per week for the use of heralds for twenty consecutive weeks, which would\nmake a total of $285.00 for the one hundred thousand edition we have ordered. By charging\nthis amount weekly it would simplify the account and at the end of the twenty weeks, the\nheralds would be paid for, and the Baker Theatre would have the $285.00 which has been\ncredited Mr. Hart's account.\n\nPlease write me upon receipt of this letter, stating whether or not you"
