Dear 113° s Zweifal:-
I racaiveá & letter from 140 Thalheiner yesterday in which he statos
that the Hart account for the hereids used by the Belle or New York is An an unsettled
condition, and that he has been unable to obtain the weekly statenent from them. 1 am
got surpriaed at this, as Mr. Hart understanda that resuittunce are not to be made direct
to bis, as the printing to is doing for the Bells of New York 18 to apply on his adeount
for the prógramse privillice at the Baker Theatre, Racheater. : would therefore suggest
that 1949 pay for them the same 00 10 did in the Stranger in New York heralds a for 800⑉
sona mgo. The entire emerant is 4285. & merd I have suggested to Abo that $24.85 be
charged him for twanty consecutive weeks starting the week after this letter is received,
making the check payable to Ii J. Shuhart, and sand it anch wook over to the Baker Theatre
or direct to this officer to this way the entire credit 02 $285.00 will be given the
Baker Theatre at the ompiration CY the twanty wasks, And the herelds will have been paid
for. I hepe this 18 entirezy plain 10 you and that you will have no trouble in spranging
the matter satiSfactorily complicating your statement.
Mrs. Zweifel wyoto in too seats for the Saturday matinoe at this theatre, and
I sent the to her today, so I imagiha aho is doming over to 506 Andrew Maok bafore the
and of the engagement.
: here you are having or plea#ant trip, and that you will write podasionally.
I received the cráticjem's of the verious Vorns, and am keeping a BoTep book of their hare.

Yours very truly,

Dear Abe:-
a
I received your favor of the 27th, and have written to Mr. Hart instruo ing
his that he must be more careful in making your shipments, and also requesting him to
tie the packages more securely in the future.
In regard to the statement, I think it would be a good idea to make payments
as we did with the Stranger in New York heralds & few asasons ago, as the remittances
for this printing mus not be made direct to Hart, but to J. J. Shubert, Baker Theatre,
Rochester, or direct to this office instead, as Mr. Hart is not to have this money but
it in to be raid to the Baker, and applied on his programme account. I would suggest
with starting next week, or rather the week after this letter is received, that you
charge $14.25 per week for the use of heralds for twebty consecutive weeks, which would
make a total of $285.00 for the one hundred thousand edition we have orderså. By charging
this amount weekly it would simplify the account and at the end of the twenty roeks, the
heralds would be paid for, and the Eaker Theatre would have the $885.00 which has been
credited Mr. Hart's account.
Please WT its MB upon receipt of this letter, stating whether 1570 not non
