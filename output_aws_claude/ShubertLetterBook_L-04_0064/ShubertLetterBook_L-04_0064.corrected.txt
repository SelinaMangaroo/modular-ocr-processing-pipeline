Sept. 9th, 1901
TO the Postmaster,
New York, City.
Dear Sir:-
I wish to direct your attention to a matter which does not seem to me to be
entirely just, and I would thank you if you would inform me as to the equity of the
transaction.
A week ago I mailed about 175 cards exactly like the enclosed, about
three days after that they were returned to the office with the stamps cancelled, and
with the information that a new act had been passed by Congress, which made it necessary
for printed cards to be the exact size of the card issued and sold by the U. S. Government. I have been using these cards for a long time, and if it is true that the card
is too large to pass under the present law, it occurs to me that this should have been
discovered before the cancellation of the stamps as I am told at the branch office here,
that there is no way I can recover the amount of postage, and furthermore, that they
will not accept and send them if they are trimmed down to the regulation size, unless
they are stamped again. Will you kindly let me know if I have been properly informed.
Very truly,
M.A.Leincher.
Business Manager.
