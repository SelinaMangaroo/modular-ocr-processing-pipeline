    "Sept. 9th, 1901\nTO the Postmaster,\nNew York, City.\nDear Sir:-\nI wish to direct your attention to a matter which does not seem to me to be\nentirely just, and I would thank you if you would inform me as to the equity of the\ntransaction.\nA week ago I mailed about 175 cards exactly like the enclosed, about\nthree days after that they were returned to the office with the stamps cancelled, and\nwith the information that a new act had been passed by Congress, which made it necessary\nfor printed cards to be the exact size of the card issued and sold by the U. S. Government. I have been using these cards for a long time, and if it is true that the card\nis too large to pass under the present law, it occurs to me that this should have been\ndiscovered before the cancellation of the stamps as I am told at the branch office here,\nthat there is no way I can recover the amount of postage, and furthermore, that they\nwill not accept and send them if they are trimmed down to the regulation size, unless\nthey are stamped again. Will you kindly let me know if I have been properly informed.\nVery truly,\nM.A.Leincher.\nBusiness Manager."
