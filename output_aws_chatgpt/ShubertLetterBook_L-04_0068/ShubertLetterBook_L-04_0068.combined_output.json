    "3rd 1901.  \n8  \nMr. Mart Printer,  \nSouth Avenue,  \nRochester, N. Y.  \nDear 10% Horts-  \nI have just received a form from V. Thalkeiner in which he states that the shipping instructions given by his for the Belle us New York followers have not been followed carefully, and that as a consequence in many cases the circulars have arrived too late to be distributed properly. He has asked me to make a request that his orders be followed carefully in the Active, and that the orders be filled more promptly. In shipping paper to B. City by freight, especially in the far west where packages are handled a member of the team, they should be packed and tied more securely, as many of the packages have been broken open when received. I wish you would look this matter up, as I imagine it must be carelessness in your shipping department, of which you are not aware.  \nYours very truly,  \nA. To -:-  \nI enclose a letter from Salt Lake City which speaks for itself: the matter has probably been taken care of by this.  \nThey open on Monday with \"The New Yorkers\"; it is Ben Daly's new show and I sincerely hope it will prove a successful engagement for the house: it certainly looks like a winner.  \nYours very truly,"
