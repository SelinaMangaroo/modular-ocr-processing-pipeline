    "6 Oct, 1901.  \nM. Patrick Ford,  \nThe Irish World,  \n17 Barley St, City.  \n\nDear Sir:  \nYour bill of Dot, last account for advertising \"Andrew Mack\" received, and I wish to say that this theatre has not placed advertising matter after the first week of the performance with your publication. The first announcement which came at the time of the opening was authorized here, and for which we agreed to pay $10.00. If any later advertising was placed it must have been done by Mr. Bob Hack, who represents Rich and Harris, and it will be necessary to collect the amount of your bill from Mr. Hogarty, Manager of the Company now at the Theatre, or of Mr. Harris at the Garrick Theatre. I thought I would write and tell you, so that you might have time to settle the matter before the company closes Saturday night. The insertion authorized by us has been paid for.  \n\nYours truly,"
