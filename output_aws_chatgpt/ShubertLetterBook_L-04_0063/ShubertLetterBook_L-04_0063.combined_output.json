    "3  \nAugust 28th, 1901.  \nMr. Peter McCourt,  \nMgr. Tabor Grand,  \nDenver, Col.  \nMy dear Mr. McCourt:  \nYours regarding La Junta at hand, and I cannot afford to play a town the size of Junta unless I can get a guarantee.  \nThanking you for your kindness, I am,  \nYours very truly,  \n& A Thares",
    "August 28th, 1901.  \nDeshler Welsh, Each  \nBusiness Manager,  \nThe Brixton Burglary,  \nHollis Street Theatre,  \nBoston, KABB.  \nDear Mr. Welsh:  \nI need not tell you that we were extremely disappointed in the opening business at Boston. It was a great disappointment, and even with the season and weather to contend with, the opening should have been much better. The very first performance of the play at Albany, before it had a New York reputation and with nothing to commend it excepting the cast, was nearly as good as Monday night; the gross being $240.00. I wish you would kindly send to this office at your earliest convenience the Sunday \"Ads\" and advance notices, as it may be that we have made a mistake in the manner in which our advertising has been placed. Whatever is at fault, we should remedy it at once, and we wish you would kindly study the conditions carefully and try to arouse a greater interest in the play.  \nI wish to call your attention to the fact that the word comedy does not appear in your daily \"Ads\" at present; this is very essential, as the title itself suggests melodrama."
