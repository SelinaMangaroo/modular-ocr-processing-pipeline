Dear Mr. Welsh:-
1 need not tell you that we were extremely disappointed in the
opening business at Beston. It was a great diaappointment an even with the season
and weather to contend with the opening should have been much better; The very first
penformance of the play at Albany before it had a New York reputation and with nothing
to commend it excepting the cast, was nearly as good as Honday night; the gross being
$240.00. I wish you would kindly send to this office at your earliest convenience
the Sunday "Ada" and advance notices, as it may be that we have made a mistake in the
manner in which our advertising has been placed. Whatever is at fault we should
reaedy it at once, and we wish you would kindly study the conditions carefully, and
try to arouse a greater interest in the play.
I wish to call your attention to the fact, that the word comedy does not
appear in your daily "Ads" at present; this is very essential, as the title itself
suggest melodrama.
