    "August 23rd, 1901.  Mr. E. L. Moore,  Mgr. Columbia Theatre,  Bellaire, Ohio.  My dear Mr. Moore:  I will be in Bellaire either Thursday night or Friday morning.  Kindly make it a point to see me as early as possible: I will either stop at the Anderson or Windsor Hotel. Should you be in the vicinity of either one Thursday evening, kindly look me up in the register: also have all the paper in the bill room, and I will make up the stands. From Bellaire, the Company plays Chicago. I am confident after you have witnessed our performance you will not regret booking the show as the best Belle of New York that has ever been on the road.  Yours very truly,",
    "August 28th, 1901.  V. R. Lipps, Esq.,  Massillon, Ohio.  Dear Sir:  Your letter at hand regarding the Belle of New York, and I am somewhat afraid that your town is a trifle too small for an expensive attraction like the Belle of New York. Our Company contains at least 95% of the last season's cast. Inasmuch as we played Canton and Akron last season, you can easily find out what an expensive attraction the Belle really is: however, I might possibly arrange to give you a date providing you can guarantee my share will not be less than $500.00 sharing at 80-20%. The only dates I have available would be during the week of March 17th, 1902. Should these terms meet your views at the time available, kindly advise me c/o Great Northern Theatre, Chicago, Ill.  Yours truly,  Business Manager,  Belle of New York."
