    "Oct. 3rd, 1901.  \n12. Pred V. Treify], HEAD  \nBello at Num York,  \nPortland, Dregon.  \nDear 113° s Zweifal:-  \nI racaiveá a letter from 140 Thalheiner yesterday in which he statos that the Hart account for the hereids used by the Belle of New York is in an unsettled condition, and that he has been unable to obtain the weekly statement from them. I am not surprised at this, as Mr. Hart understands that remittances are not to be made direct to him, as the printing he is doing for the Bells of New York is to apply on his account for the programme privilege at the Baker Theatre, Rochester. I would therefore suggest that 1949 pay for them the same as 10 did in the Stranger in New York heralds a few seasons ago. The entire amount is $4285. I have suggested to Abe that $24.85 be charged him for twenty consecutive weeks starting the week after this letter is received, making the check payable to J. J. Shuhart, and send it each week over to the Baker Theatre or direct to this office. This way the entire credit of $285.00 will be given to the Baker Theatre at the expiration of the twenty weeks, and the heralds will have been paid for. I hope this is entirely plain to you and that you will have no trouble in arranging the matter satisfactorily complicating your statement.  \nMrs. Zweifel wrote in too seats for the Saturday matinee at this theatre, and I sent them to her today, so I imagine she is coming over to 506 Andrew Mack before the end of the engagement.  \nI hope you are having a pleasant trip, and that you will write occasionally.  \nI received the criticisms of the various forms, and am keeping a notebook of their hare.  \nYours very truly,  \nBelle of New York,  \nMark  \nDenver, Col.  \nDear Abe:-  \nI received your favor of the 27th, and have written to Mr. Hart instructing him that he must be more careful in making your shipments, and also requesting him to tie the packages more securely in the future.  \nIn regard to the statement, I think it would be a good idea to make payments as we did with the Stranger in New York heralds a few seasons ago, as the remittances for this printing must not be made direct to Hart, but to J. J. Shubert, Baker Theatre, Rochester, or direct to this office instead, as Mr. Hart is not to have this money but it is to be paid to the Baker, and applied on his programme account. I would suggest with starting next week, or rather the week after this letter is received, that you charge $14.25 per week for the use of heralds for twenty consecutive weeks, which would make a total of $285.00 for the one hundred thousand edition we have ordered. By charging this amount weekly it would simplify the account and at the end of the twenty weeks, the heralds would be paid for, and the Baker Theatre would have the $285.00 which has been credited to Mr. Hart's account.  \nPlease write to me upon receipt of this letter, stating whether or not..."
