TO the Postmaster,  
New York City.  
Dear Sir,  
I wish to direct your attention to a matter which does not seem to me to be entirely just, and I would thank you if you would inform me as to the equity of the transaction.  
A week ago, I mailed about 178 cards exactly like the one mentioned, and about three days after that, they were returned to the office with the stamps cancelled, and with the information that a new act had been passed by Congress, which made it so printed cards had to be the exact size of the card issued and sold by the Government. I have been using these cards for a long time, and if it is true that the card in question is too large to pass under the present law, it seems to me that this should have been discovered before the cancellation of the stamps. I am told at the branch office here that there is no way I can recover the amounts of postage, and furthermore, that they will not accept and send them if they are trimmed down to the regulation size, unless they are unsent again. Please kindly let me know if I have been properly informed.  
Very truly,  
M.A. Leincher  
Business Manager.
