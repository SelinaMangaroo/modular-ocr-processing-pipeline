Dear Sir,  
In answer to your request of recent date, I enclose you a check for $10.00 balance in Child: 0 date about account Bellen & Beaux. I have looked this matter carefully and find that this settles the matters in full in accordance with a letter I hold from you under date of June. I really feel that the act has paid you a percentage or many of the weeks which you did not assist in booking, and every single week, with the exception of two while the act has played, were booked outside the Association; however, it is our intention to give up to our agreements, and we would have continued indefinitely had you suggested the discontinuation yourself.  
Yours truly,  
Sept. 20th 1901.  
Homer B. Nason,  
Hotel Wellington or Hopkins Theatre,

Will give you just four hours to wire our money here.

If Homer starts anything today, do what you can with others to maintain harmony. Advise Sextette finishing week: new people coming.
